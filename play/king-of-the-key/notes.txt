omg notes insane
I'm just gonna write everything I think about with this level and all my ideas
idrc if anyone reads it

probably gonna add one or two more things I was thinking to add a fully solid block with a collider that is on all sides but that sounds kinda hard

I also wanna add invisible blocks idk if that will be hard

it wasn't that hard

I think maybe if I use a mix of the code from the block collision system and the function that checks if I'm collecting a key I can do the fully solid block


I'll see


I'm currently builfing level three rn I hope that all the levels don't take long

gonna implement:

double spikes at level 3
moving blocks at level 5
invis blocks at level 6
triple spikes at level nine but only maybe because those are really hard


I honestly probably won't do the all sides collider thing because I can't really see a use for it apart from blocking something off or a head hitter jump


10/80/22 things I still need to do:
build levels 3-10
add the title screen
make a way to put in a game over screen
add the proper death screen
add the end/spash screen

honestly I'm getting there
just a lot of level building to do


I'm thinking to add a bonus heart just in case the levels get to hard, I have already added a yellow heart for the fifth one but I wanna make a in game collectable that increases your lives

I'll probably copy the code for the key collectable if I implement this


I kinda wanna add a teleporter, I don't think that would be too hard because it only needs a collision system and a thing that sets the players y coordinate

ok there was a small bug with the teleporters but I fixed it and now they work
the problem was that the teleporter would make an infinite loop if you just did player_y = teleport y
so I originally did: player_y = teleportY + 50
but that still overlapped so I did:
player_y = teleport_y + 51
but that had an annoying glitch for a while were I would pass through blocks and I wouldn't be able to jump but then I remembered that the player need to be at a position that is a multiple of 5 because when you fall you go down five pixels each frame


ok gonna change what I said before:
gonna implement teleporters at level 4
invis blocks at level 5
moving blocks at level 6


I could make it so when you get a key you get another life but at the same time I feel like that would make it wayyyy to easy


I ended up adding invis blocks in level four kinda by accidentt but I'm gonna keep it anyway and add teleporters at level 5

started adding some textures today I added the:
locked goal
unlocked goal
teleporters
key
and player


was gonna add some kevin macloud music in the background but p5 doesn't like big sound files for some reason, when I tried to play the file it kept glitching

just finished level 5, 10 more to go

gonna try and grind out the levels, I can probably get this whole thing done before this time next week its currently 10/31/22
yes I'm doing this on halloween

I've decided to have four modes, easy, normal, hard and speed mode


started level 9 gonna add triple spikes
now that there is the mode with infinite respawns



to do:
add death screen
add game over screen
add title screen:
    add info
    add modes
    add credits
add sounds
add end screen
some fun easter eggs


to do updated:
add more skins (maybe)

add end screen
some fun easter eggs

to do updated X3:

I've added all the sound effects now
I just found a way to play big audio files lessgooooooo

I think that the game is done, I love this project a lot but I'm happy its finished
